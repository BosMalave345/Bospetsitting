# Bo’s Pet Sitting — GitHub Pages Starter

A clean, mobile‑friendly static site for Bo’s Pet Sitting (Houston & The Woodlands). No build tools required. Just push and it goes live.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `bos-pet-sitting`).
2. Upload these files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, README.md) to the root of the repo.
3. Commit to the `main` branch.
4. In **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` / `/ (root)`
5. Your site will be published at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

> Tip: If you name the repo `<your-username>.github.io`, the site will publish at the root domain.

## Customize
- Edit **index.html** text for services, pricing, and contact info.
- Swap colors in **styles.css** by changing the `:root` variables.
- The contact form opens an email draft — works on static hosting with no backend.

## Custom Domain (optional)
1. Buy a domain from your provider (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains).
2. In **Settings → Pages**, add your domain under **Custom domain**.
3. Add DNS A/ALIAS or CNAME as GitHub instructs and enable HTTPS.

## Notes
- This template avoids frameworks so it works out‑of‑the‑box on Pages.
- You can add analytics (e.g., G‑tag) by pasting the script into `index.html` head.
